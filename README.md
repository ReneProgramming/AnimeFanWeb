This project by [Rene Hernandez](https://github.com/ReneProgramming), is a project that will incorporate the use of ASP.NET Core.
be a Data Driven dynamic website, and will have source control.

## Description

having to individually search for such things.

# User Watchlist

This is a watch list that the user can use to keep track of their place for the shows they are watching <br/>
as well as marking them as finished watching or if they plan to watch them. It works with the catalog <br/>
list as you add a show from the catalog and saves it to the watch list.
